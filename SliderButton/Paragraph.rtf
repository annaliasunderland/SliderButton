In a similar sense to how the click has become the domineering way that that we perform actions through the browser, tapping on buttons has become the go-to way perform actions through the smart phone. The issue is that while tapping buttons is the equivalent to clicking on the browser, the smartphone has the added capabilities of touch. So is tapping really the best way? Should our navigation on the smart phone be more gestural? Our Sliding Button widget seeks to offer an alternative way to navigate through the mobile realm. In our example, we use the sliding button widget as a different way of sending a message to someone by sliding up on the message to send. You could say that \'93well what if someone accidentally slides up on the phone and accidentally sends something?\'94 To reduce the chances of that happening, the user must press on the small tab and then swipe up for it to register as sending. The sliding button widget can also be used to go to confirm (holding on the nib on the left and and swiping right) or cancel (holding on the nib on the right and swiping left). }
