{"name":"SliderButton","tagline":"A more natural gestural iOS control","body":"\r\n***\r\n### The Concept\r\nIn a similar sense to how the click has become the domineering way that that we perform actions through the browser, tapping on buttons has become the go-to way perform actions through the smart phone. Tapping buttons is the equivalent to clicking buttons on the web browser, but with the smartphone's added capability of touch, is tapping really the best gesture to use? \r\n\r\nThe SliderButton offers an alternative, more gestural way to navigate through the mobile realm. Instead of tapping buttons, a user must press on a small tab and swipe either left, right, or up (depending on the SliderButton) to complete an action.\r\n\r\n### Addressing Concerns\r\n\r\n*Sample Up-sliding SliderButtons:*\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asunderl/SliderButton/master/slidingUp.gif)\r\n\r\n**How easy is it for a user to accidentally swipe up/left/right?**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it's much easier to accidentally tap on a button than swipe. Second, to reduce the chances of that happening, the user must press on the small tab (as opposed to the entire enclosing box) and swipe up/left/right for it to register as sending. To maintain ease of use though, there's a threshold of approximately 75% of the enclosing box after which your swipe gesture follows through, otherwise the tab snaps back to the beginning and the action has not completed.\r\n\r\n**What can you use the SliderButton for?**\r\n\r\nBasically anything you could use a button for: it replaces the button.\r\n\r\n**Sliding for an action doesn't seem as natural as tapping a virtual button though. Don't we tap buttons in real life (e.g. on vending machines)?**\r\n\r\nOur point is not to make the screen translatable to real life, since the screen is by definition a virtual world and not the non-virtual world where buttons exist. The buttons we tap on our phones and screens are not real 3d buttons that can be pressed in. Our phones primarily incorporate swipe gestures, so it is more natural to our fingers to swipe up to send a message upward to our text conversation, for example, or swipe left or right to do things. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Sample Left & Right-sliding SliderButtons:*\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asunderl/SliderButton/master/slidingLeftRight.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nConcept & Design by Kevin Cadena (@kcaden20)\r\n\r\nImplementation by Annalia Sunderland (@asunderl)\r\n\r\nFor Brown CSCI1300 course, Fall 2015.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
